### Description of the Keylogger

A keylogger is a malicious software used to record all the keystrokes in a user in hopes of using all the information recorded in the "KeyLog.txt"(or named any kind) file, for malicious intent
This keylogger software is made to get a copy of each keystroke of a user. The keystroke format is shown as a ".txt" file formatted as (TIME/DATE:KEYSTROKE).
This software is made for educational purposes only! Use it at your discretion.

*This software won't work in a attack because the computer antivirus already has a signature for this kind of code*
